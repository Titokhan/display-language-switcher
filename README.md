# Notes #

- If you later want to go back to original language or already installed multiple languages
run the script and you will be prompted to select one of detected languages to set as primary

- The script will not set or change the local language preferences:
Formats, Location, Keyboards, language for non-unicode programs (system locale)

you can set them manually, before or after changing the display language:
Windows 7     : "Region and Language" Control Panel
Windows 8/8.1 : "Region", "Language" Control Panels
Windows 10    : "Region", "Language" Control Panels, or Settings app

- It is recommended for Windows 8/8.1 to enable .NET Framework 3.5 feature before installing new language

- All files in "FOD" folder will be installed on Windows 10 without checking
make sure to download and place the correct files matching Windows 10 version and architecture

- To spare yourself the trouble, keep the work directory path short, do not use spaces and do not use non-ASCII characters.
